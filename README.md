# Fuel Efficiency prediction

Source:

This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.

## Data Set Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

### Attribute Information:

1. mpg : fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (continuous)
2. cylinders : Number of cylinders in a car (multi-valued discrete)
3. displacement : in cubic inches (continuous)
4. horsepower : (continuous)
5. weight : weight of car in pounds (continuous)
6. acceleration : (continuous)
7. model year : (multi-valued discrete)
8. origin : 1,2,3 (multi-valued discrete)
9. car name : string (unique for each instance)

Total 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes

## Objective - 
Prediction of city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon given attributes

## Assumptions - 
origin is taken as 1: USA 2:Europe 3: Asia for convenience
