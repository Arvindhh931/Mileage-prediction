Source:

This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.

## Data Set Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

### Attribute Information:

1. mpg : continuous
2. cylinders : multi-valued discrete
3. displacement : continuous
4. horsepower : continuous
5. weight : continuous
6. acceleration : continuous
7. model year : multi-valued discrete
8. origin : multi-valued discrete
9. car name : string (unique for each instance)
